# Tent FAQ

#### What is Tent?
Tent is a protocol that Apollic Software, LLC has created in an effort to help decentralize social services. This means Tent is a similar in concept to email or the Internet.

#### Are Tent and Tent.is the same thing?
No. Tent is a protocol; Tent.is is the first Tent server that is available to the public.

#### Did I win if I got my preferred username on Tent.is?
Not necessarily. While Tent.is is the first freely available Tent server for anyone to sign up on, it will not be the only one. Mentions in Tent can go cross-domain to other Tent implementations, meaning you can contact anybody on the Internet who has an account on a Tent server. This, however, does not mean that Tent.is usernames are completely unimportant; getting one is similar to getting an awesome email address on GMail or Outlook.com.

#### Are there more post types available to me? 
Yes, there are several post types besides the microbloging-style 256 character posts. There are also essays, photos, and albums. You are not limited to these though; anybody can create an entirely new post type that does anything you can imagine. See http://www.tent.io/docs/post-types for more information on post types.

#### Are there apps yet? Can they do anything super nifty?
At the time of writing, there have been a few command line clients (apps) and there are a few for various platforms that are entering beta (or alpha) but are not ready to be used by the average user. Clients are one of the best parts of Tent;

#### Why do you use the caret (^) instead of the at sign (@)?
Tent.is uses the caret because it looks like a little tent. Any tent server can implement its own syntax for mentions.
